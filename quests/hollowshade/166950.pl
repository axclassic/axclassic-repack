##Angelox: This wasn't working before and problems started after Pat corrected
##So maybe Aardil made a new script that worked and is the why for the multi spawns
##I'm quoting it out
# sub EVENT_SPAWN{
#   quest::signalwith(166971,816,0);
#   quest::signalwith(166972,818,0);
#   quest::signalwith(166987,3070,0);
# }
# sub EVENT_DEATH{
# quest::signalwith(166582,516,250000);
# }
