## EQWorld Server 19-12-2010        ##
## By: Angelox                      ##
## Revised by Caved for Clinklinks  ##
## Second revision by EQPlayer 	    ##
## UPDATE 2/8/16 Fixed and cleanup  ##
## variables now within subroutines ##
######################################
## Further Notes:
## Ranger Band will now let you know if an Event is active.
## Also, he will speak to you relating to the events currently going on.
## Event5 is the Random moonstone Event, but has been implemented to only be active
## if you are currently participating in the Ladder Rankings. Otherwise, you have
## to hunt for the moonstones yourself - Patrik.
## UPDATE- SAYLINKS placed back in subroutines!
